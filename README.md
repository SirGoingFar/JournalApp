JOURNAL APP:
This app allows users to manage their diary entries. It has the CRUD actions which the user can perform.
The content of user's diary is parsed for URL detections. Should the content has any, there is an in-app web browser which the
user can use to surf the content of the web URL. Two types of browsers are built in - the app leverages the Custom Chrome Tab
for users having Google Chrome installed and a WebView widget for users without Google Chrome.
Every 4-hour interval, the app sends a notification to the user, as a reminder, to preview their diary entries.
User session is well managed in this application - another user can log into his/her account using your app without interrupting with your
diary catalog.
